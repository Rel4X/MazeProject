HandyMaze
=========

HandyMaze is a maze generator with its solver and its drawer. It can generate huge mazes (more than 20k * 20k).

I have used the "EasyBMP" library by Paul Macklin for the drawing part.

Only available on Windows for now.

Launching line :
./HandyMaze SIZE_OF_LAB [-ia]

-ia : Activate de AI solving of the maze plus the drawing of a picture of the maze with the path
